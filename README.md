# Samantha R. Sexton - Full Stack Web Developer Portfolio
This is the repo for my personal site - detailing my work and experience as a
full stack developer.

*UPDATE:* I have recently decided to redesign my portfolio to better reflect new skills/interests/objectives, and as such this project is no longer hosted live. To view it you may pull the project & `open index.html`.
